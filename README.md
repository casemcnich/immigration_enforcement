# Immigration Enforcement Labor Project
The following repository contains R files associated with my immigration enforcement dissertation chapter. 

### Workflow ###
A majority of files in this project are used to obtain and merge data from TRAC, QCEW, IPUMS, and FOIED data. Data are stored offline. 

See here for a full walkthrough of the workflow.
